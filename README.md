# pathPlanning

Repository to demonstrate different path planning methods in a grid based environment. Each algorithm is given a starting location, a goal, and a map with obstacles to avoid.

Todos:

* Make the search algorithms more robust to situations where there is no path
* Make the search algorithms more robust when there is a path, it might just be harder to find (tune, use different heuristics, etc.)
* Visualize the algorithms while they are path planning
* Add BFS, DFS, and RRT search algorithms
